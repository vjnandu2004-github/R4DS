    "With more features than observations, models can memorize noise instead of learning generalizable patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex models (e.g., deep neural networks, decision trees) are especially prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low bias but high variance → Poor performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Multicollinearity\n",
    "Many features may be highly correlated, making it hard to interpret coefficients (e.g., in regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "Leads to unstable model estimates (coefficients can swing wildly with small data changes).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Insufficient Degrees of Freedom\n",
    "Many statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) require more observations than predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression models (linear/logistic) may fail to converge or produce unreliable p-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Feature Selection & Dimensionality Reduction Challenges\n",
    "Traditional feature selection methods (e.g., stepwise regression) struggle with p >> n (more predictors than samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) may not work well if most features are noisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Computational Issues\n",
    "Some algorithms (e.g., SVM, kernel methods) scale poorly with high dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix operations (e.g., inversion in OLS regression) may fail due to singular matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Data Sparsity & Missing Values\n",
    "With many columns, missing data becomes a bigger problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imputation methods (mean, median, MICE) may introduce bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Model Interpretability\n",
    "High-dimensional models (e.g., LASSO, random forests) may select arbitrary features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "A 136×111 dataset is wide but shallow, leading to overfitting, multicollinearity, and unreliable statistical inferences. Dimensionality reduction, regularization, and careful feature selection are essential for meaningful analysis.\n"
